Likely the engineer. Most engineers actually spend nontrivial time between
projects, mostly in planning phase (helping plan next project or
retrospecting previous) or taking care of some other small little doodad
that we humans have determined is important to take care of b/w projects.

Doesn't happen b/w every project, but happens a lot. If we find ourselves
w/ lots of "w/ literally one day I can respond to A/B results and make a
tweak due to our learnings," a between-project day is perfectly healthy and
encouraged.
